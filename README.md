This was created as part of MDN's Express tutorial.

A Node.js project created with Express. This project uses Mongoose to model data that is then passed to the MongoDB database. The app utilizes the MVC architectural pattern to keep the code structured, with Pug functioning as the templating engine. The app has full CRUD capabilies, allowing users to create and interact with books, authors, genres, and book instances within the database.
